<h1>The Best Movies According to Annie</h1>
<h2>My top3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bodkin</h3>
<p>
1.“Bodkin” succeeds in a landscape of thrillers and true crime expansions. <br />
2.It expertly crafts a riveting mystery but also fleshes out its central – and supporting – characters.<br />
3.A series like this hinges on the chemistry of the show’s cast, and thankfully, each and every player gives it their all. <br />
</p>
<h3>Flipside</h3>
<p>
1.“Flipside” then depicts how this state of affairs came to be.<br />
2. Wilcha presents a brisk account of his early years, 
 the no-sell-out grunge ethos he grew up with as a Gen Xer, 
 and how, upon taking a corporate job at Columbia House, he interrogated a system he despised from the inside,
  actually finishing an eventually well-regarded 2000 documentary “The Target Shoots First.” <br />
</p>
<h3>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</h3>
<p>
1.To do any further summarizing would, of course, not only spoil the film, 
but would also say that the narrative beats are necessary. They’re not. <br />
2.That doesn’t mean “Furiosa” is illogical, rather that, more than anything, 
Miller is telling an emotional story of how a once virtuous child became a hardened woman. <br />
